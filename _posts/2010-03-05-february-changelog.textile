Welcome to the second monthly changelog post! February was a big month for Gemcutter: a main goal of the project was realized with the release of RubyGems 1.3.6 along with plenty of other work. Another big change is that @gem yank@ has been implemented finally with gemcutter 0.5.0, and John Trupiano made a great screencast to show off how it works:

h4. Features

*gem yank*: Plenty of work was done based on discussion on the "Gemcutter mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/gemcutter on finally being able to remove gems from the site's index. The motivation behind why it works this way is best explained by "On Retagging":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html from the git tag manpage. Here's a small summary of the changes:

* If you've botched a gem release, you can use @gem yank [gemname]@ to remove it from the index. Fix the problem, bump by a patch version, and push the newly built gem. You're not going to run out of version numbers any time soon!
* The gem is still available for download, and the gem is not deleted from S3. This prevents a _why type situation where important community gems could suddenly disappear, and allows other gem authors to be able to use it if necessary.
* If you need a gem perma-deleted, open a support request at "help.rubygems.org":http://help.rubygems.org and we'll take care of it.
* Yanked a gem you didn't mean to? Run @gem yank --undo@ to put the gem back into the index.

*RubyGems Integration*: RubyGems.org is now the default gem host in RubyGems, @gem push@ and @gem owner@ have been merged into RubyGems proper. Plenty of copy and documentation changes were done too.

h4. Fixes

*Atomic Versions*: Re-pushing of gems is now disabled since @gem yank@ is implemented.

*Staging Server*: We finally have a staging server to test out major changes. We upgraded the site to the latest Passenger and REE too on production!

*Load Path Fixes*: Some cleanup of the @LOAD_PATH@ has been performed for the latest gemcutter gem.

*Gemcutter Gem Refactoring*: As of RubyGems 1.3.6, utilities have been added to help use the Gemcutter API, so @gem webhook@ and @gem yank@ now take advantage of this.

*Destroy Subscriptions on RubyGem Destroy*: This was causing some problems on user dashboards.

*Force Redirects for Other Domains*: Visiting pages on the web frontend at gemcutter.org or gems.rubyforge.org redirect you to rubygems.org.

*Updating Legacy Indexes*: A new RubyGems release means that the old legacy indexes had to be updated for old RG clients to be able to auto-update.

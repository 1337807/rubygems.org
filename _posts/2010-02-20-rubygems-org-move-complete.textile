As you may have noticed, Gemcutter has now become RubyGems.org. This transition has been in the works for "several months now":http://update.gemcutter.org/2009/10/26/transition.html, and the new RubyGems 1.3.6 release brings it to a close. The original goal of Gemcutter was to improve the RubyGem hosting scene for everyone in the Ruby community, and it's been realized now.

For those concerned with what's going to change, here's some basic information about what's happened to bring you up to speed:

* gemcutter.org, gems.rubyforge.org, and rubygems.org all point to the same place
* gem serving/installing will continue to work for all 3 domains
* rubygems.org is the default gem source as of RubyGems 1.3.6
* rubygems.org is the main web frontend now, and the other two sites redirect to it
* @gem owner@ and @gem push@ have been merged into RubyGems proper.
* The gemcutter gem as of 0.4.0 just has @gem webhook@ (and soon, @gem yank@!)
* The GitHub project, Twitter account, etc name will remain the same

Going forward, we'll eventually be using gemcutter.org for gem forking/subdomains, and gems.rubyforge.org will probably remain inactive. I'd also like to say thanks to "Eric Hodel":http://segment7.net, "Tom Copeland":http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/, and "John Barnette":http://www.jbarnette.com/, their help with making this all happen has been immeasurable.

If you've got questions about the transition, let us know in the comments!

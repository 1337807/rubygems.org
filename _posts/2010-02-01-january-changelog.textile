h4. Features

*Webhooks*: Get notifications for specific gems or all gems when new versions are pushed. "Read up here.":http://gemcutter.org/pages/gem_docs#webhook

*CloudFront*: We're now serving all gems older than a day from CloudFront, which should speed up downloads immensely.

*RubyGems Support Site*: Need help with Gemcutter or RubyGems? "Look no further":http://help.rubygems.org

*Metrics/Caliper Integration*: Shiny new button on every gem's page, and Caliper generates metric_fu results for every pushed gem. Awesome.

*Gem Payload Additions: Gem URI, Project URI, Version Downloads, Dependencies*: Plenty added to the API hash, "check out an example":http://gemcutter.org/pages/api_docs

*Search API method*: An alternative to @gem search@ that hooks into the same search box on the site at @/api/v1/search.(xml|json)?query="SOME GEM"@

*XML API Payload*: For those who enjoy 3-letter acronyms when querying their gems. "More on the API docs.":http://gemcutter.org/pages/api_docs

h4. Fixes

*Switched to postfix*: We used to just use GMail for our mail server when we were on Heroku, but now we can use the server's postfix server to send mail.

*Strip string on search*: Putting spaces in search queries would give bad results, so now they're stripped away.

*More legacy indexes*: Some of the legacy indexes that old versions of RubyGems were not being served up. They're now all served up with just @rubygems-update@ in them.

*Redirecting to all indexes on S3*: Instead of trying to cache the indexes through the Hostess, we now redirect to S3 for all of the indexes we can. See for yourself with @gem install -V@.

*Moving gems to /downloads*: Search engine crawlers were bumping download counts, so we've moved gem downloads on @rubygems#show@ to @/downloads@ and added that to @robots.txt@ so they don't bump up the counts.

*Various CSS fixes on rubygems#show*: Too many authors, downloads, or even a long title would break the page layout, hopefully that's fixed now.

*ILIKE*: This was put in since Gemcutter uses PostgreSQL but would hinder contributors wanting to use MySQL. It's now removed and we should be DB agnostic again.
